For this assignment I chose to develop an application to allow the user to simulate a game of blackjack.

This assignment allowed me to learn the following:

    Use asynchronous JavaScript tools to build a responsive web application.
    Demonstrate understanding of the JavaScript event loop.
    Generate asynchronous code using Promises and async/await syntax.
    Use fetch and/or Axios to interact with an external web API.
    Organize files using modules and imports.


The game allows the user to view their opening hand at the bottom and make choices on whether to hit and stand using the buttons.
The cheat button allows the user to swap out the deck with a new one that has jokers, maybe to even make the opponent draw a joker and lose.
